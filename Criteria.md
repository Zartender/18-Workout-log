# Unit 18: NoSQL

## Overview
In the late 90s and early 2000s, developers began to explore database options that allowed their web applications to handle unstructured data to meet the growing and ever-changing demands of users and address the limitations of the relational model. While these alternative databases existed for decades prior, they didnâ€™t receive the label NoSQL until this time period.  

The structure of a NoSQL database is something other than a table. There are several different types of NoSQL databases, such as key-value and graph. In this unit we will learn MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database. MongoDB documents correspond to a row, or record, in SQL, but unlike rows, documents are analogous to JSON objects. You can see why MongoDB is a popular choice for Node.js developers! 

Rather than object-relational mapping, we will implement object-_document_ mapping, or ODM, with Mongoose.js. 

## Key Topics
* NoSQL
* MongoDB
* Object-document mapping
* Mongoose.js
* CRUD

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?
##### SQL is an integer/number base database. 
##### NoSQL generall is beneficial for a db that contains more text/characters than numbers.

2. What is object-document mapping? 
##### Mapping to a Document.
3. What is the equivalent of Sequelize associations in Mongoose.js? 
##### Populate

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL
###### The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends entirely on individual circumstances as both of them have advantages as well as disadvantages. SQL databases are long established with fixed schema design and a set structure. They are ideal for applications that require multi-row transactions such as an accounting system or for legacy systems that were built for a relational structure.

##### On the other hand, NoSQL databases are easily scalable, flexible and simple to use as they have no rigid schema. They are ideal for applications with no specific schema definitions such as content management systems, big data applications, real-time analytics, etc.

* Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB
* Explain and execute CRUD methods with MongoDB, using both the  and Mongoose.js
* Use both a GUI and the Mongo command prompt to interface with a database
* Integrate Mongoose in a full-stack web application
* Create query builders to populate documents using refs

## Homework: Workout Tracker
Create and deploy full-stack workout tracker application. This assignment will require you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.
